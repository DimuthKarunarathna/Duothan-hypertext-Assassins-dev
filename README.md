Welcome to our coding competition project, a fully functional website that connects users with pharmacies to help them locate the medicine they need. Our website allows users to search for specific medications and find out which pharmacies have them in stock and at which locations. With this information, users can quickly and easily locate the pharmacy closest to them that has the medicine they need. Our website is designed with user convenience in mind, offering a simple and intuitive interface that makes finding medicine a breeze. Thank you for using our website, and we hope it helps you find the medicine you need.
